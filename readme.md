# Generative Art | Saquif

This is a gallery of some of the generative art I am making. Generative Art is one of my newer passions and I wanted to showcase some of the work I am doing, which are hosted on this [website](https://ssaquif.github.io/generative-art-react/).

If you want to learn more about Generative Art yourself, you can see [this repo](https://github.com/SSaquif/generative-art) where I put my notes on the topic. You will also find links to useful resources that helped me get started.
